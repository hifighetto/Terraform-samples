# Exclude all .tfvars files, which are likely to contain sentitive data, such as
# password, private keys, and other secrets. These should not be part of version 
# control as they are data points which are potentially sensitive and subject 
# to change depending on the environment.

# For one reason or another I want to include some default variables - HG
# *.tfvars

# Ignore override files as they are usually used to override resources locally and so
# are not checked in
# I am not planning on using overrides, but i will change my mind later -HG
# override.tf
# override.tf.json
# *_override.tf
# *_override.tf.json

# Include override files you do wish to add to version control using negated pattern
#
# !example_override.tf

# Include tfplan files to ignore the plan output of command: terraform plan -out=tfplan
# example: *tfplan*

# Ignore CLI configuration files
# I should not be allowe to weird this power -GH
# .terraformrc
# terraform.rc
