# Terraform-samples

Each directory will have it's own readme for what the project entails.</br>

Please also see the [blog](https://hifighetto.com) for the related text and videos.  </br>

These samples are the "Use at your own risk" type and should be used to further knowledge and not as an end all. Please see the documents on the [terraform registry](https://registry.terraform.io) for each module referenced and further documentation.
